# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To keep the package green:

1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Run the quality gate before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   composer format         # Pint (laravel preset + strict types)
   composer analyse        # PHPStan level 8, empty baseline
   composer test-coverage  # Pest, 100% line coverage on src/
   ```
3. Every PHP file starts with `<?php`, a blank line, then `declare(strict_types=1);`.
4. No `final` classes (an arch test forbids them).
5. Target Filament v5 — avoid APIs that are not available on the supported majors.
6. Add tests and update the [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) under `Unreleased`.
